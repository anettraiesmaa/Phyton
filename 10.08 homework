#1. Create two DataFrame Grass and Water
grass_df = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Grass']
water_df = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Water']

#2. Create the regression plots for each (Grass and Water)
sns.regplot(
    data=grass_df, x='Speed', y="Defense",
    ci=99, marker="x", color=".3", line_kws=dict(color="r"),
)

sns.regplot(
    data=water_df, x='Speed', y="Defense",
    ci=99, marker="x", color=".3", line_kws=dict(color="r"),
)

#Calculate the Pearson correlation for each DataFrame (variables: Attack and Defense)
correlation4 = grass_df['Attack'].corr(grass_df['Defense'])
print('Pearson correlation coefficient:', correlation4)

correlation4 = water_df['Attack'].corr(water_df['Defense'])
print('Pearson correlation coefficient:', correlation4)

Explanation: both grass and water pokemons have a moderate positive correlation (grass pokemons a bit stronger) between attack and defense
